# Ajax CRUD Rest Api Example

Here, we will be building a little app which performs **CRUD** operations (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE respectively) .CRUD stands for create, read. update, delete.

 * Create (POST) - Make something
 
 * Read (GET) - Get something
 
 * Update (PUT) - Change something
  
 * Delete (DELETE)- Remove something

We will be using a **basic express server**. For more details on how to setup express server please refer to the below link.

**Rest api** is used to perform operations on data. Rest Api stands for representational state transfers. It is a interface which uses HTTP requests to perform GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
